instructions on VMming everything and howto

Yet another not-quite-technically code repo, but since others do similar.....

What is here is detailed instructions (for demo purposes) on how to clone-rescue, clone-restore, use VM trick and techniques to snapshot real OSes with REAL HARDWARE, and how to simulate as many OSes as possible, albeit not at the same time.

I also have instructions on VFIO thru EFI- the new Linux gaming technique that doesnt waste a hard drive(if youve got a tower and a spare graphics card-its worth a try).

Some got it working on ARCH.

I got it working on Ubuntu.
