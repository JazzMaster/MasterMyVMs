the fedora /redhat virtial IO drivers disc is needed. (vio-cd.iso)
(get it from REDHAT/Fedora download link)

might want to keep your video drivers disc (or a dl copy of the installer) handy for the VFIO hardware as well.
Im noticing cdrom access issues- but it might be my hardware being flaky.

(heaven forbid this is a QEMU or UBUNTU problem.....which I believe it to be)

a SMB or "samba share" on the linux side (properly configured and running as a daemon on boot) should ease the NEIGHBORHOOD.....
map a few drives and you have a "virtual LAN".

steam games can be moved.
additional hdd (or cdroms) can also be added
