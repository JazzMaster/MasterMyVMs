this is a bitch to get working!!!

UEFI only likes things a certain way
non-UEFI likes things another way

-fuck either up and you cant install 8

UEFI wants enforced WHQL drivers and the discs are NOT!
msconfig -> recover-> boot options
3 menus deeper ->disable enforcement(7)

either way:

extract radeon drivers-
    manuallly install all inf files

hard reboot everything-vfio takes but hangs.

UEFI should allow disconnect of qxl.
seabios DOES NOT.
